[Chorus]
Could've been a lover
Could've been what you needed
Could've been whatever
Could've been what you're seeking
Instead you took my sweater
With no intentions to return it
Now I'm kinda bitter, now I'm kinda bitter
Now I'm kinda bitter ('Cause I)
Could've been a lover (Could've)
Could've been what you needed (Been what)
Could've been whatever (Ever)
Could've been what you're seeking
Instead you took my sweater (My sweater, babe)
With no intentions to return it (No intentions to return it)
Now I'm kinda bitter
Now I'm kinda bitter

[Verse 1]
All I know is I miss you babe
It's been hard to get you on the phone (Hello)
I talk like I forget you but you already know this
I'm focused, can't stop me now
I'm on and I'm lit
I got four bitches in my phone right now
But they ain't worth it to me
You fit in my life perfectly

[Chorus]
Could've been a lover
Could've been what you needed (Could've been)
Could've been whatever (Whatever you want me to be)
Could've been what you're seeking
Instead you took my sweater (Instead you took my sweater)
With no intentions to return it
Now I'm kinda bitter, now I'm kinda bitter
Now I'm kinda bitter ('Cause I)
Could've been a lover (Everything)
Could've been what you needed
Could've been whatever (Whatever)
Could've been what you're seeking (I could've been)
Instead you took my sweater
With no intentions to return it (No intentions to return it)
Now I'm kinda bitter
Now I'm kinda bitter

[Verse 2]
Oh, baby, I'm so bitter
It's breaking me down inside (Why you got me hurting babe?)
Yeah, the way that I'm feeling is the reason I can't let it slide (Could've been the one)
I didn't wanna say it but I can't get it off of my mind
Wanted to save my tongue
But I just can't do that no more
